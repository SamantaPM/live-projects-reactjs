# Live Coding Exercise

This is an exercise completed during an interview, in less than 1 hour.

Build a simple Todo List component with these requirements:

1. A text input and a button to add a new todo.

2. Each todo should display with a "Remove" button next to it.

3. When there are no todos, show a placeholder message like: "No todos yet.".

4. Keep the state inside the component (no Redux/Context yet).

## React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
