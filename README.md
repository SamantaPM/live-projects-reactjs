## Live Coding Exercise 1: TODO LIST

Build a simple Todo List component with these requirements:

A text input and a button to add a new todo.

Each todo should display with a "Remove" button next to it.

When there are no todos, show a placeholder message like: "No todos yet.".

Keep the state inside the component (no Redux/Context yet).

## Live Coding Exercise 2: SEARCH USER

Build a Searchable User List component.

Requirements:

1. You have an array of users (hardcoded inside the component for now), e.g.:

const users = [
  { id: 1, name: "Alice" },
  { id: 2, name: "Bob" },
  { id: 3, name: "Charlie" },
  { id: 4, name: "David" }
];


2. Render all users in a list.

3. Add a search input at the top.

4. As the user types, filter the list by name (case-insensitive).

5. If no users match, display "No users found.".

**Bonus (optional, if you want extra challenge):**

- Extract the search input into its own component (<SearchBox />) and pass the query up.
  
## Live Coding Exercise 3 (React Router): MINI BLOG

Build a Mini Blog App with React Router.

Requirements:

1. Set up 3 routes:
   - / ‚Üí Home page ‚Üí shows a welcome message.
   - /posts ‚Üí Posts page ‚Üí shows a list of posts (hardcoded array).
   - /posts/:id ‚Üí Post Details page ‚Üí clicking a post in the list takes you here and shows its title + content.

2. Navigation:
   - Add a simple nav bar with links to Home and Posts.
   - Active link should be visually different (hint: NavLink in React Router).

3. Posts data (put in a local file or inside Posts.jsx for now):
```
  const posts = [
    { id: 1, title: "First Post", content: "This is the first post." },
    { id: 2, title: "Second Post", content: "This is the second post." },
    { id: 3, title: "Third Post", content: "This is the third post." }
  ];
```

**Bonus (optional, extra credit)**
- Add a "Back to Posts" link on the details page.
- Show "Post not found" if the id doesn‚Äôt exist.

## Live Coding Exercise 4 ‚Äî Global State + Router: MINI CART

You‚Äôre building a mini shopping cart app.

Requirements:

1. Use React Router for pages:

  - /products ‚Üí shows a list of products.
  - /cart ‚Üí shows the shopping cart.

2. Use Context API (no Redux yet) to manage the cart state.
3. A product should have: id, name, and price.
4. On the /products page, show a list of products with an ‚ÄúAdd to Cart‚Äù button.
5. On the /cart page, list all items currently in the cart and show the total price.
6. Add a NavBar so the user can navigate between /products and /cart.

üëâ Your goal:

- Set up the CartContext provider.
- Implement the /products and /cart pages using that shared state.
